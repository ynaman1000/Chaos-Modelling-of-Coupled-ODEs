# ME789_project: Chaos modelling of coupled ODEs

Abstract: 
a) Short introduction: We will be studying the double inverted pendulum. It is used to show an example of chaos dynamics, signifying the importance of initial conditions in non-linear systems. Since, these chaotic non-linear systems also exist in nature, for example weather prediction based on past history, etc. Therefore, studying this chaotic non-linear system is important in terms of actual applications also.
b) Methodology: Solving coupled ODEs using implicit method and studying the effect of change in the initial conditions on the trajectory of the end point of the second link (sensitivity analysis). Also, studying how the phase portrait of the system evolves over time.
c) Implementation: As of now we will use C++ for programming, however if necessary we may use some other language such as Python, MATLAB, for graph plotting or some other visual presentation. We will be using implicit method for solving the ODEs.
