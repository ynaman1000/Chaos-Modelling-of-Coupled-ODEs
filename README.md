# ME789_project: Chaos modelling of coupled ODEs

## Abstract
a) Short introduction: We will be studying the double inverted pendulum. It is used to show an example of chaos dynamics, signifying the importance of initial conditions in non-linear systems. Since, these chaotic non-linear systems also exist in nature, for example weather prediction based on past history, etc. Therefore, studying this chaotic non-linear system is important in terms of actual applications also.

b) Methodology: Solving coupled ODEs using implicit method and studying the effect of change in the initial conditions on the trajectory of the end point of the second link (sensitivity analysis). Also, studying how the phase portrait of the system evolves over time. Comparing and contrasting between several solving methods, such as Implicit method, Explicit method, Runge-Kutta methods, etc.

c) Implementation: Python.
